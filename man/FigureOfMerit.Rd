\description{
Calculate the figure of merit at different levels and at different resolutions
for a reference map at time 1, a reference map at time 2 and a simulated map
at time 2.
}
\details{
In land use change modelling the figure of merit is the intersection of
observed change and simulated change divided by the union of these, with a
range of 0 (perfect disagreement) to 1 (perfect agreement). It is useful to
calculate the figure of merit at three levels: (1) considering all possible
transitions from all land use categories, (2) considering all transitions from
specific land use categories and (3) considering a specific transition from
one land use category to another.
